    "#### External Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever needed information that wasn’t r eady to go  in a file? Things like reference information, up-to-the-minute updated data, or data from an external vendor or another team within your organization?\n",
    "\n",
    "__How can we go about sourcing that information, and what problems did you encounter?__\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Welcome to the Neighborhood!\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs, or __application programming interfaces__, are data sources that can give you access to information from all sorts of places on the internet. Simply put, an API is a system that receives <span style=\"color: red;font-weight: bold\">requests </span> and returns <span style=\"color: blue;font-weight: bold\">responses</span>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"img/16_API_exchange.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### It's All Interfaces \n",
    "\n",
    "We are used to numerous __interfaces__ in real life. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __A door handle :__  We don’t care how a door works, all   that   we expect is that pushing or pulling the handle will open the door. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __File → Print :__   We don’t care how the computer prints the document, all that we expect is that using the “Print” option in the “File” menu will result in the document being printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Kind of Data Is Served Up With an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’d be difficult to find data that __doesn’t__ have an API. Common uses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Social media integration__ : When you post something on Instagram, you can automatically have it post to Facebook as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Payment APIs__  : When you want to send or receive money via Venmo (US) or Beem (in AU), the app directly interfaces with your bank or financial institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Maps__ : Many apps like Uber, Lyft, and Waze are built on top of existing map services like Google Maps or Mapbox.\n",
